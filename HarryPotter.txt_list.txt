Mr
and
Mrs
Dursley
of
number
four
Privet
Drive
were
proud
to
say
that
they
were
perfectly
normal
thank
you
very
much
They
were
the
last
people
youd
expect
to
be
involved
in
anything
strange
or
mysterious
because
they
just
didnt
hold
with
such
nonsense
Mr
Dursley
was
the
director
of
a
firm
called
Grunnings
which
made
drills
He
was
a
big
beefy
man
with
hardly
any
neck
although
he
did
have
a
very
large
moustache
Mrs
Dursley
was
thin
and
blonde
and
had
nearly
twice
the
usual
amount
of
neck
which
came
in
very
useful
as
she
spent
so
much
of
her
time
craning
over
garden
fences
spying
on
the
neighbours
The
Dursleys
had
a
small
son
called
Dudley
and
in
their
opinion
there
was
no
finer
boy
anywhere
The
Dursleys
had
everything
they
wanted
but
they
also
had
a
secret
and
their
greatest
fear
was
that
somebody
would
discover
it
They
didnt
think
they
could
bear
it
if
anyone
found
out
about
the
Potters
Mrs
Potter
was
Mrs
Dursleys
sister
but
they
hadnt
met
for
several
years
in
fact
Mrs
Dursley
pretended
she
didnt
have
a
sister
because
her
sister
and
her
goodfornothing
husband
were
as
unDursleyish
as
it
was
possible
to
be
The
Dursleys
shuddered
to
think
what
the
neighbours
would
say
if
the
Potters
arrived
in
the
street
The
Dursleys
knew
that
the
Potters
had
a
small
son
too
but
they
had
never
even
seen
him
This
boy
was
another
good
reason
for
keeping
the
Potters
away
they
didnt
want
Dudley
mixing
with
a
child
like
that
When
Mr
and
Mrs
Dursley
woke
up
on
the
dull
grey
Tuesday
our
story
starts
there
was
nothing
about
the
cloudy
sky
outside
to
suggest
that
strange
and
mysterious
things
would
soon
be
happening
all
over
the
country
Mr
Dursley
hummed
as
he
picked
out
his
most
boring
tie
for
work
and
Mrs
Dursley
gossiped
away
happily
as
she
wrestled
a
screaming
Dudley
into
his
high
chair
None
of
them
noticed
a
large
tawny
owl
fl
utter
past
the
window
At
half
past
eight
Mr
Dursley
picked
up
his
briefcase
pecked
Mrs
Dursley
on
the
cheek
and
tried
to
kiss
Dudley
goodbye
but
missed
because
Dudley
was
now
having
a
tantrum
and
throwing
his
cereal
at
the
walls
Little
tyke
chortled
Mr
Dursley
as
he
left
the
house
He
got
into
his
car
and
backed
out
of
number
fours
drive
It
was
on
the
corner
of
the
street
that
he
noticed
the
fi
rst
sign
of
something
peculiar

a
cat
reading
a
map
For
a
second
Mr
Dursley
didnt
realise
what
he
had
seen

then
he
jerked
his
head
around
to
look
again
There
was
a
tabby
cat
standing
on
the
corner
of
Privet
Drive
but
there
wasnt
a
map
in
sight
What
could
he
have
been
thinking
of
It
must
have
been
a
trick
of
the
light
Mr
Dursley
blinked
and
stared
at
the
cat
It
stared
back
As
Mr
Dursley
drove
around
the
corner
and
up
the
road
he
watched
the
cat
in
his
mirror
It
was
now
reading
the
sign
that
said
Privet
Drive

no
looking
at
the
sign
cats
couldnt
read
maps
or
signs
Mr
Dursley
gave
himself
a
little
shake
and
put
the
cat
out
of
his
mind
As
he
drove
towards
town
he
thought
of
nothing
except
a
large
order
of
drills
he
was
hoping
to
get
that
day
But
on
the
edge
of
town
drills
were
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
something
else
As
he
sat
in
the
usual
morning
traffi
c
jam
he
couldnt
help
noticing
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
strangely
dressed
people
about
People
in
cloaks
Mr
Dursley
couldnt
bear
people
who
dressed
in
funny
clothes

the
get
ups
you
saw
on
young
people
He
supposed
this
was
some
stupid
new
fashion
He
drummed
his
fi
ngers
on
the
steering
wheel
and
his
eyes
fell
on
a
huddle
of
these
weirdos
standing
quite
close
by
They
were
whispering
excitedly
together
Mr
Dursley
was
enraged
to
see
that
a
couple
of
them
werent
young
at
all
why
that
man
had
to
be
older
than
he
was
and
wearing
an
emeraldgreen
cloak
The
nerve
of
him
But
then
it
struck
Mr
Dursley
that
this
was
probably
some
silly
stunt

these
people
were
obviously
collecting
for
something

yes
that
would
be
it
The
traffi
c
moved
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
Mr
Dursley
arrived
in
the
Grunnings
car
park
his
mind
back
on
drills
Mr
Dursley
always
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
in
his
offi
ce
on
the
ninth
floor
If
he
hadnt
he
might
have
found
it
harder
to
concentrate
on
drills
that
morning
He
didnt
see
the
owls
swooping
past
in
broad
daylight
though
people
down
in
the
street
did
they
pointed
and
gazed
open
mouthed
as
owl
after
owl
sped
overhead
Most
of
them
had
never
seen
an
owl
even
at
night
time
Mr
Dursley
however
had
a
perfectly
normal
owl
free
morning
He
yelled
at
fi
ve
different
people
He
made
several
important
telephone
calls
and
shouted
a
bit
more
He
was
in
a
very
good
mood
until
lunchtime
when
he
thought
hed
stretch
his
legs
and
walk
across
the
road
to
buy
himself
a
bun
from
the
bakers
opposite
Hed
forgotten
all
about
the
people
in
cloaks
until
he
passed
a
group
of
them
next
to
the
bakers
He
eyed
them
angrily
as
he
passed
He
didnt
know
why
but
they
made
him
uneasy
This
lot
were
whispering
excitedly
too
and
he
couldnt
see
a
single
collecting
tin
It
was
on
his
way
back
past
them
clutching
a
large
doughnut
in
a
bag
that
he
caught
a
few
words
of
what
they
were
saying

The
Potters
thats
right
thats
what
I
heard


yes
their
son
Harry

Mr
Dursley
stopped
dead
Fear
fl
ooded
him
He
looked
back
at
the
whisperers
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
them
but
thought
better
of
it
He
dashed
back
across
the
road
hurried
up
to
his
offi
ce
snapped
at
his
secretary
not
to
disturb
him
seized
his
telephone
and
had
almost
fi
nished
dialling
his
home
number
when
he
changed
his
mind
He
put
the
receiver
back
down
and
stroked
his
moustache
thinking

no
he
was
being
stupid
Potter
wasnt
such
an
unusual
name
He
was
sure
there
were
lots
of
people
called
Potter
who
had
a
son
called
Harry
Come
to
think
of
it
he
wasnt
even
sure
his
nephew
was
called
Harry
Hed
never
even
seen
the
boy
It
might
have
been
Harvey
Or
Harold
There
was
no
point
in
worrying
Mrs
Dursley
she
always
got
so
upset
at
any
mention
of
her
sister
He
didnt
blame
her

if
hed
had
a
sister
like
that

but
all
the
same
those
people
in
cloaks

He
found
it
a
lot
harder
to
concentrate
on
drills
that
afternoon
and
when
he
left
the
building
at
fi
ve
oclock
he
was
still
so
worried
that
he
walked
straight
into
someone
just
outside
the
door
Sorry
he
grunted
as
the
tiny
old
man
stumbled
and
almost
fell
It
was
a
few
seconds
before
Mr
Dursley
realised
that
the
man
was
wearing
a
violet
cloak
He
didnt
seem
at
all
upset
at
being
almost
knocked
to
the
ground
On
the
contrary
his
face
split
into
a
wide
smile
and
he
said
in
a
squeaky
voice
that
made
passers
by
stare
Dont
be
sorry
my
dear
sir
for
nothing
could
upset
me
today
Rejoice
for
YouKnowWho
has
gone
at
last
Even
Muggles
like
yourself
should
be
celebrating
this
happy
happy
day
And
the
old
man
hugged
Mr
Dursley
around
the
middle
and
walked
off
Mr
Dursley
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
He
had
been
hugged
by
a
complete
stranger
He
also
thought
he
had
been
called
a
Muggle
whatever
that
was
He
was
rattled
He
hurried
to
his
car
and
set
off
home
hoping
he
was
imagining
things
which
he
had
never
hoped
before
because
he
didnt
approve
of
imagination
As
he
pulled
into
the
driveway
of
number
four
the
fi
rst
thing
he
saw

and
it
didnt
improve
his
mood

was
the
tabby
cat
hed
spotted
that
morning
It
was
now
sitting
on
his
garden
wall
He
was
sure
it
was
the
same
one
it
had
the
same
markings
around
its
eyes
Shoo
said
Mr
Dursley
loudly
The
cat
didnt
move
It
just
gave
him
a
stern
look
Was
this
normal
cat
behaviour
Mr
Dursley
wondered
Trying
to
pull
himself
together
he
let
himself
into
the
house
He
was
still
determined
not
to
mention
anything
to
his
wife
Mrs
Dursley
had
had
a
nice
normal
day
She
told
him
over
dinner
all
about
Mrs
Next
Doors
problems
with
her
daughter
and
how
Dudley
had
learnt
a
new
word
Shant
Mr
Dursley
tried
to
act
normally
When
Dudley
had
been
put
to
bed
he
went
into
the
living
room
in
time
to
catch
the
last
report
on
the
evening
news
And
fi
nally
bird
watchers
everywhere
have
reported
that
the
nations
owls
have
been
behaving
very
unusually
today
Although
owls
normally
hunt
at
night
and
are
hardly
ever
seen
in
daylight
there
have
been
hundreds
of
sightings
of
these
birds
fl
ying
in
every
direction
since
sunrise
Experts
are
unable
to
explain
why
the
owls
have
suddenly
changed
their
sleeping
pattern
The
news
reader
allowed
himself
a
grin
Most
mysterious
And
now
over
to
Jim
McGuffi
n
with
the
weather
Going
to
be
any
more
showers
of
owls
tonight
Jim
Well
Ted
said
the
weatherman
I
dont
know
about
that
but
its
not
only
the
owls
that
have
been
acting
oddly
today
Viewers
as
far
apart
as
Kent
Yorkshire
and
Dundee
have
been
phoning
in
to
tell
me
that
instead
of
the
rain
I
promised
yesterday
theyve
had
a
downpour
of
shooting
stars
Perhaps
people
have
been
celebrating
Bonfi
re
Night
early

its
not
until
next
week
folks
But
I
can
promise
a
wet
night
tonight
Mr
Dursley
sat
frozen
in
his
armchair
Shooting
stars
all
over
Britain
Owls
fl
ying
by
daylight
Mysterious
people
in
cloaks
all
over
the
place
And
a
whisper
a
whisper
about
the
Potters

Mrs
Dursley
came
into
the
living
room
carrying
two
cups
of
tea
It
was
no
good
Hed
have
to
say
something
to
her
He
cleared
his
throat
nervously
Er

Petunia
dear

you
havent
heard
from
your
sister
lately
have
you
As
he
had
expected
Mrs
Dursley
looked
shocked
and
angry
After
all
they
normally
pretended
she
didnt
have
a
sister
No
she
said
sharply
Why
Funny
stuff
on
the
news
Mr
Dursley
mumbled
Owls

shooting
stars

and
there
were
a
lot
of
funny
looking
people
in
town
today

So
snapped
Mrs
Dursley
Well
I
just
thought

maybe

it
was
something
to
do
with

you
know

her
lot

Mrs
Dursley
sipped
her
tea
through
pursed
lips
Mr
Dursley
wondered
whether
he
dared
tell
her
hed
heard
the
name
Potter
He
decided
he
didnt
dare
Instead
he
said
as
casually
as
he
could

Their
son

hed
be
about
Dudleys
age
now
wouldnt
he
I
suppose
so
said
Mrs
Dursley
stiffl
y
Whats
his
name
again
Howard
isnt
it
Harry
Nasty
common
name
if
you
ask
me
Oh
yes
said
Mr
Dursley
his
heart
sinking
horribly
Yes
I
quite
agree
He
didnt
say
another
word
on
the
subject
as
they
went
upstairs
to
bed
While
Mrs
Dursley
was
in
the
bathroom
Mr
Dursley
crept
to
the
bedroom
window
and
peered
down
into
the
front
garden
The
cat
was
still
there
It
was
staring
down
Privet
Drive
as
though
it
was
waiting
for
something
Was
he
imagining
things
Could
all
this
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Potters
If
it
did

if
it
got
out
that
they
were
related
to
a
pair
of

well
he
didnt
think
he
could
bear
it
The
Dursleys
got
into
bed
Mrs
Dursley
fell
asleep
quickly
but
Mr
Dursley
lay
awake
turning
it
all
over
in
his
mind
His
last
comforting
thought
before
he
fell
asleep
was
that
even
if
the
Potters
were
involved
there
was
no
reason
for
them
to
come
near
him
and
Mrs
Dursley
The
Potters
knew
very
well
what
he
and
Petunia
thought
about
them
and
their
kind

He
couldnt
see
how
he
and
Petunia
could
get
mixed
up
in
anything
that
might
be
going
on
He
yawned
and
turned
over
It
couldnt
affect
them

How
very
wrong
he
was
Mr
Dursley
might
have
been
drifting
into
an
uneasy
sleep
but
the
cat
on
the
wall
outside
was
showing
no
sign
of
sleepiness
It
was
sitting
as
still
as
a
statue
its
eyes
fi
xed
unblinkingly
on
the
far
corner
of
Privet
Drive
It
didnt
so
much
as
quiver
when
a
car
door
slammed
in
the
next
street
nor
when
two
owls
swooped
overhead
In
fact
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
the
cat
moved
at
all
A
man
appeared
on
the
corner
the
cat
had
been
watching
appeared
so
suddenly
and
silently
youd
have
thought
hed
just
popped
out
of
the
ground
The
cats
tail
twitched
and
its
eyes
narrowed
Nothing
like
this
man
had
ever
been
seen
in
Privet
Drive
He
was
tall
thin
and
very
old
judging
by
the
silver
of
his
hair
and
beard
which
were
both
long
enough
to
tuck
into
his
belt
He
was
wearing
long
robes
a
purple
cloak
which
swept
the
ground
and
high
heeled
buckled
boots
His
blue
eyes
were
light
bright
and
sparkling
behind
half
moon
spectacles
and
his
nose
was
very
long
and
crooked
as
though
it
had
been
broken
at
least
twice
This
mans
name
was
Albus
Dumbledore
Albus
Dumbledore
didnt
seem
to
realise
that
he
had
just
arrived
in
a
street
where
everything
from
his
name
to
his
boots
was
unwelcome
He
was
busy
rummaging
in
his
cloak
looking
for
something
But
he
did
seem
to
realise
he
was
being
watched
because
he
looked
up
suddenly
at
the
cat
which
was
still
staring
at
him
from
the
other
end
of
the
street
For
some
reason
the
sight
of
the
cat
seemed
to
amuse
him
He
chuckled
and
muttered
I
should
have
known
He
had
found
what
he
was
looking
for
in
his
inside
pocket
It
seemed
to
be
a
silver
cigarette
lighter
He
fl
icked
it
open
held
it
up
in
the
air
and
clicked
it
The
nearest
street
lamp
went
out
with
a
little
pop
He
clicked
it
again

the
next
lamp
fl
ickered
into
darkness
Twelve
times
he
clicked
the
PutOuter
until
the
only
lights
left
in
the
whole
street
were
two
tiny
pinpricks
in
the
distance
which
were
the
eyes
of
the
cat
watching
him
If
anyone
looked
out
of
their
window
now
even
beady
eyed
Mrs
Dursley
they
wouldnt
be
able
to
see
anything
that
was
happening
down
on
the
pavement
Dumbledore
slipped
the
PutOuter
back
inside
his
cloak
and
set
off
down
the
street
towards
number
four
where
he
sat
down
on
the
wall
next
to
the
cat
He
didnt
look
at
it
but
after
a
moment
he
spoke
to
it
Fancy
seeing
you
here
Professor
McGonagall
He
turned
to
smile
at
the
tabby
but
it
had
gone
Instead
he
was
smiling
at
a
rather
severelooking
woman
who
was
wearing
square
glasses
exactly
the
shape
of
the
markings
the
cat
had
had
around
its
eyes
She
too
was
wearing
a
cloak
an
emerald
one
Her
black
hair
was
drawn
into
a
tight
bun
She
looked
distinctly
ruffl
ed
How
did
you
know
it
was
me
she
asked
My
dear
Professor
Ive
never
seen
a
cat
sit
so
stiffl
y
Youd
be
stiff
if
youd
been
sitting
on
a
brick
wall
all
day
said
Professor
McGonagall
All
day
When
you
could
have
been
celebrating
I
must
have
passed
a
dozen
feasts
and
parties
on
my
way
here
Professor
McGonagall
sniffed
angrily
Oh
yes
everyones
celebrating
all
right
she
said
impatiently
Youd
think
theyd
be
a
bit
more
careful
but
no

even
the
Muggles
have
noticed
somethings
going
on
It
was
on
their
news
She
jerked
her
head
back
at
the
Dursleys
dark
living
room
window
I
heard
it
Flocks
of
owls

shooting
stars

Well
theyre
not
completely
stupid
They
were
bound
to
notice
something
Shooting
stars
down
in
Kent

Ill
bet
that
was
Dedalus
Diggle
He
never
had
much
sense
You
cant
blame
them
said
Dumbledore
gently
Weve
had
precious
little
to
celebrate
for
eleven
years
I
know
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
irritably
But
thats
no
reason
to
lose
our
heads
People
are
being
downright
careless
out
on
the
streets
in
broad
daylight
not
even
dressed
in
Muggle
clothes
swapping
rumours
She
threw
a
sharp
sideways
glance
at
Dumbledore
here
as
though
hoping
he
was
going
to
tell
her
something
but
he
didnt
so
she
went
on
A
fi
ne
thing
it
would
be
if
on
the
very
day
YouKnowWho
seems
to
have
disappeared
at
last
the
Muggles
found
out
about
us
all
I
suppose
he
really
has
gone
Dumbledore
It
certainly
seems
so
said
Dumbledore
We
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
Would
you
care
for
a
sherbet
lemon
A
what

A
sherbet
lemon
Theyre
a
kind
of
Muggle
sweet
Im
rather
fond
of
No
thank
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
coldly
as
though
she
didnt
think
this
was
the
moment
for
sherbet
lemons
As
I
say
even
if
YouKnowWho
has
gone

My
dear
Professor
surely
a
sensible
person
like
yourself
can
call
him
by
his
name
All
this
YouKnowWho
nonsense

for
eleven
years
I
have
been
trying
to
persuade
people
to
call
him
by
his
proper
name
Voldemort

Professor
McGonagall
fl
inched
but
Dumbledore
who
was
unsticking
two
sherbet
lemons
seemed
not
to
notice
It
all
gets
so
confusing
if
we
keep
saying
YouKnowWho
I
have
never
seen
any
reason
to
be
frightened
of
saying
Voldemorts
name
I
know
you
havent
said
Professor
McGonagall
sounding
half
exasperated
half
admiring
But
youre
different
Everyone
knows
youre
the
only
one
YouKnow

oh
all
right
Voldemort

was
frightened
of
You
fl
atter
me
said
Dumbledore
calmly
Voldemort
had
powers
I
will
never
have
Only
because
youre
too

well

noble
to
use
them
Its
lucky
its
dark
I
havent
blushed
so
much
since
Madam
Pomfrey
told
me
she
liked
my
new
earmuffs
Professor
McGonagall
shot
a
sharp
look
at
Dumbledore
and
said

The
owls
are
nothing
to
the
rumours
that
are
fl
ying
around
You
know
what
everyones
saying
About
why
hes
disappeared
About
what
fi
nally
stopped
him
It
seemed
that
Professor
McGonagall
had
reached
the
point
she
was
most
anxious
to
discuss
the
real
reason
she
had
been
waiting
on
a
cold
hard
wall
all
day
for
neither
as
a
cat
nor
as
a
woman
had
she
fi
xed
Dumbledore
with
such
a
piercing
stare
as
she
did
now
It
was
plain
that
whatever
everyone
was
saying
she
was
not
going
to
believe
it
until
Dumbledore
told
her
it
was
true
Dumbledore
however
was
choosing
another
sherbet
lemon
and
did
not
answer
What
theyre
saying

she
pressed
on
is
that
last
night
Voldemort
turned
up
in
Godrics
Hollow
He
went
to
fi
nd
the
Potters
The
rumour
is
that
Lily
and
James
Potter
are

are

that
theyre

dead

Dumbledore
bowed
his
head
Professor
McGonagall
gasped
Lily
and
James

I
cant
believe
it

I
didnt
want
to
believe
it

Oh
Albus

Dumbledore
reached
out
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
I
know

I
know

he
said
heavily
Professor
McGonagalls
voice
trembled
as
she
went
on

Thats
not
all
Theyre
saying
he
tried
to
kill
the
Potters
son
Harry
But

he
couldnt
He
couldnt
kill
that
little
boy
No
one
knows
why
or
how
but
theyre
saying
that
when
he
couldnt
kill
Harry
Potter
Voldemorts
power
somehow
broke

and
thats
why
hes
gone
Dumbledore
nodded
glumly
Its

its
true

faltered
Professor
McGonagall
After
all
hes
done

all
the
people
hes
killed

he
couldnt
kill
a
little
boy
Its
just
astounding

of
all
the
things
to
stop
him

but
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
Harry
survive
We
can
only
guess
said
Dumbledore
We
may
never
know
Professor
McGonagall
pulled
out
a
lace
handkerchief
and
dabbed
at
her
eyes
beneath
her
spectacles
Dumbledore
gave
a
great
sniff
as
he
took
a
golden
watch
from
his
pocket
and
examined
it
It
was
a
very
odd
watch
It
had
twelve
hands
but
no
numbers
instead
little
planets
were
moving
around
the
edge
It
must
have
made
sense
to
Dumbledore
though
because
he
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
said
Hagrids
late
I
suppose
it
was
he
who
told
you
Id
be
here
by
the
way
Yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
And
I
dont
suppose
youre
going
to
tell
me
why
youre
here
of
all
places
Ive
come
to
bring
Harry
to
his
aunt
and
uncle
Theyre
the
only
family
he
has
left
now
You
dont
mean

you
cant
mean
the
people
who
live
here

cried
Professor
McGonagall
jumping
to
her
feet
and
pointing
at
number
four
Dumbledore

you
cant
Ive
been
watching
them
all
day
You
couldnt
fi
nd
two
people
who
are
less
like
us
And
theyve
got
this
son

I
saw
him
kicking
his
mother
all
the
way
up
the
street
screaming
for
sweets
Harry
Potter
come
and
live
here
Its
the
best
place
for
him
said
Dumbledore
fi
rmly
His
aunt
and
uncle
will
be
able
to
explain
everything
to
him
when
hes
older
Ive
written
them
a
letter
A
letter
repeated
Professor
McGonagall
faintly
sitting
back
down
on
the
wall
Really
Dumbledore
you
think
you
can
explain
all
this
in
a
letter
These
people
will
never
understand
him
Hell
be
famous

a
legend

I
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
today
was
known
as
Harry
Potter
Day
in
future

there
will
be
books
written
about
Harry

every
child
in
our
world
will
know
his
name
Exactly
said
Dumbledore
looking
very
seriously
over
the
top
of
his
half
moon
glasses
It
would
be
enough
to
turn
any
boys
head
Famous
before
he
can
walk
and
talk
Famous
for
something
he
wont
even
remember
Cant
you
see
how
much
better
off
hell
be
growing
up
away
from
all
that
until
hes
ready
to
take
it
Professor
McGonagall
opened
her
mouth
changed
her
mind
swallowed
and
then
said
Yes

yes
youre
right
of
course
But
how
is
the
boy
getting
here
Dumbledore
She
eyed
his
cloak
suddenly
as
though
she
thought
he
might
be
hiding
Harry
underneath
it
Hagrids
bringing
him
You
think
it

wise

to
trust
Hagrid
with
something
as
important
as
this
I
would
trust
Hagrid
with
my
life
said
Dumbledore
Im
not
saying
his
heart
isnt
in
the
right
place
said
Professor
McGonagall
grudgingly
but
you
cant
pretend
hes
not
careless
He
does
tend
to

what
was
that
A
low
rumbling
sound
had
broken
the
silence
around
them
It
grew
steadily
louder
as
they
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
some
sign
of
a
headlight
it
swelled
to
a
roar
as
they
both
looked
up
at
the
sky

and
a
huge
motorbike
fell
out
of
the
air
and
landed
on
the
road
in
front
of
them
If
the
motorbike
was
huge
it
was
nothing
to
the
man
sitting
astride
it
He
was
almost
twice
as
tall
as
a
normal
man
and
at
least
fi
ve
times
as
wide
He
looked
simply
too
big
to
be
allowed
and
so
wild

long
tangles
of
bushy
black
hair
and
beard
hid
most
of
his
face
he
had
hands
the
size
of
dustbin
lids
and
his
feet
in
their
leather
boots
were
like
baby
dolphins
In
his
vast
muscular
arms
he
was
holding
a
bundle
of
blankets
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sounding
relieved
At
last
And
where
did
you
get
that
motorbike
Borrowed
it
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
said
the
giant
climbing
carefully
off
the
motorbike
as
he
spoke
Young
Sirius
Black
lent
it
me
Ive
got
him
sir
No
problems
were
there
No
sir

house
was
almost
destroyed
but
I
got
him
out
all
right
before
the
Muggles
started
swarmin
around
He
fell
asleep
as
we
was
fl
yin
over
Bristol
Dumbledore
and
Professor
McGonagall
bent
forward
over
the
bundle
of
blankets
Inside
just
visible
was
a
baby
boy
fast
asleep
Under
a
tuft
of
jet
black
hair
over
his
forehead
they
could
see
a
curiously
shaped
cut
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
Is
that
where

whispered
Professor
McGonagall
Yes
said
Dumbledore
Hell
have
that
scar
for
ever
Couldnt
you
do
something
about
it
Dumbledore
Even
if
I
could
I
wouldnt
Scars
can
come
in
useful
I
have
one
myself
above
my
left
knee
which
is
a
perfect
map
of
the
London
Underground
Well

give
him
here
Hagrid

wed
better
get
this
over
with
Dumbledore
took
Harry
in
his
arms
and
turned
towards
the
Dursleys
house
Could
I

could
I
say
goodbye
to
him
sir
asked
Hagrid
He
bent
his
great
shaggy
head
over
Harry
and
gave
him
what
must
have
been
a
very
scratchy
whiskery
kiss
Then
suddenly
Hagrid
let
out
a
howl
like
a
wounded
dog
Shhh
hissed
Professor
McGonagall
Youll
wake
the
Muggles
Ss
sorry
sobbed
Hagrid
taking
out
a
large
spotted
handkerchief
and
burying
his
face
in
it
But
I
c
ccant
stand
it

Lily
an
James
dead

an
poor
little
Harry
off
ter
live
with
Muggles

Yes
yes
its
all
very
sad
but
get
a
grip
on
yourself
Hagrid
or
well
be
found
Professor
McGonagall
whispered
patting
Hagrid
gingerly
on
the
arm
as
Dumbledore
stepped
over
the
low
garden
wall
and
walked
to
the
front
door
He
laid
Harry
gently
on
the
doorstep
took
a
letter
out
of
his
cloak
tucked
it
inside
Harrys
blankets
and
then
came
back
to
the
other
two
For
a
full
minute
the
three
of
them
stood
and
looked
at
the
little
bundle
Hagrids
shoulders
shook
Professor
McGonagall
blinked
furiously
and
the
twinkling
light
that
usually
shone
from
Dumbledores
eyes
seemed
to
have
gone
out
Well
said
Dumbledore
fi
nally
thats
that
Weve
no
business
staying
here
We
may
as
well
go
and
join
the
celebrations
Yeah
said
Hagrid
in
a
very
muffl
ed
voice
Id
best
get
this
bike
away
Gnight
Professor
McGonagall

Professor
Dumbledore
sir
Wiping
his
streaming
eyes
on
his
jacket
sleeve
Hagrid
swung
himself
on
to
the
motorbike
and
kicked
the
engine
into
life
with
a
roar
it
rose
into
the
air
and
off
into
the
night
I
shall
see
you
soon
I
expect
Professor
McGonagall
said
Dumbledore
nodding
to
her
Professor
McGonagall
blew
her
nose
in
reply
Dumbledore
turned
and
walked
back
down
the
street
On
the
corner
he
stopped
and
took
out
the
silver
PutOuter
He
clicked
it
once
and
twelve
balls
of
light
sped
back
to
their
street
lamps
so
that
Privet
Drive
glowed
suddenly
orange
and
he
could
make
out
a
tabby
cat
slinking
around
the
corner
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
He
could
just
see
the
bundle
of
blankets
on
the
step
of
number
four
Good
luck
Harry
he
murmured
He
turned
on
his
heel
and
with
a
swish
of
his
cloak
he
was
gone
A
breeze
ruffl
ed
the
neat
hedges
of
Privet
Drive
which
lay
silent
and
tidy
under
the
inky
sky
the
very
last
place
you
would
expect
astonishing
things
to
happen
Harry
Potter
rolled
over
inside
his
blankets
without
waking
up
One
small
hand
closed
on
the
letter
beside
him
and
he
slept
on
not
knowing
he
was
special
not
knowing
he
was
famous
not
knowing
he
would
be
woken
in
a
few
hours
time
by
Mrs
Dursleys
scream
as
she
opened
the
front
door
to
put
out
the
milk
bottles
nor
that
he
would
spend
the
next
few
weeks
being
prodded
and
pinched
by
his
cousin
Dudley

He
couldnt
know
that
at
this
very
moment
people
meeting
in
secret
all
over
the
country
were
holding
up
their
glasses
and
saying
in
hushed
voices

To
Harry
Potter

the
boy
who
lived
